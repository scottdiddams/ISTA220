## C# HW Ch4

1. What are all possible values of Boolean expression?

*true or false*

2. List the equality operators. List the relational operators. List the logical operators. How are they the
same? How are they different?

*Equality operators: == (Equal to) and != (not equal to)*

*relational operators: < (less than); > (greater than) <= & >= (less/greater than or equal to)*

*logical operators: && (logical AND); || (logical OR); ! (Logical Not)*


3. What is the general concept of short circuiting? This question has a short and simple answer and you
do not need to have a detailed response.

*if the value to the left of the &&/|| operator fulfills the condition of the expression, the operators bypass the value to the right*

4. What are the difference in how short circuiting works for && and ||?

*FALSE&&=short circuit*

*TRUE||= short circuit*

5. Look at the list of operators. What operator has the highest precedence? Which has the lowest?

*highest:() ; lowest: = "assignment"*

6. In an if or else construction using multiple lines of code, what effect does the use of curly braces have?

*braces create a BLOCK, which allows you to perform multiple statements as a result of the boolean evaluation*

7. In a switch statement, what happens if you omit break?

*the C# compiler ends the switch function when it evaluates the break statement, if there is no break statement the switch will"fall through" to the next case or end up in a stack overflow exception*

8. The four keywords in a switch statement are switch, case, break, and default. Explain what each
keyword does.

*switch (match) = the selection statement that chooses a single switch section to execute from a list of candidates based on a pattern match with the match expression*

*case = a specified pattern to compare the match expression against*

*break = ends the process*

*default = the case to pick if none of the other case labels match the specified condition*


9. Look at the source listing below. It contains two methods: recurr1() and recurr2(). There is a
significant difference between the two methods. What is it?

*recurr2 has an extra step where it mmultiplies initial by 1 before beginning the recursion - if product is anything other than 1 the method will not demonstrate recursion*

10. (Not in book) What is a recursive method? Using a language you know (such as English), write a
recursive method that adds up the integers in a list of integers. The input to the method is a list of
integers and the output is a scalar value representing a sum.

*a recursive method is one that calls itself during its execution*

*f(x) = x + f(x-1)*

11. (Not in book) Read a short summary of De Morgan’s laws.



(a) Explain how this statement, ”It’s not snowing or raining,” is the same as this statement, ”It’s not
snowing and it’s not raining.”

*both statements can be evaluated as ((nosnow||norain)=true)=(snow&&rain=false)*

(b) Explain how this statement, ”I’m not running and walking,” is the same as this statement, ”I’m
not running or I’m not walking.”

*(run&&walk=false) is the same as ((Not running||not walking)=true)*
