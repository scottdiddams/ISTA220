## C# Programming CH1 Homework

1. What is a console app?

*a program written to be executed by the console or command prompt application with a CLI instead of a GUI*

2. List two differences between .NET Framework and .NET Core. Note that in this class, we will be
writing C# applications in .NET Framework and ASP.NET applications in NET Core.

*The .NET Core is used for portable applications that run on other operating systems, such as Linux, while .NET Framework applies only to Windows.
The .NET Framework provides a wider range of features than the .NET Core. Core is new & open source.*

3. What does Main() (the main method) do in a console application?

*The Main method designates the entry point for the console program. The computer looks for main and will only run if it finds it.
If there is no main method it is not executable.*

4. Describe these three files: TextHello.sln, TextHello.csproj, and AssemblyInfo.cs.

* The .sln file is the solution file, which is a single file created by Visual studio to organize projects.
The .csproj file is the C# project file and is a subset of the solution file.
The .cs file is the source file, which is displayed in visual studio when the application is first created.

5. What is the purpose of a namespace?

*The namespace reduces conflicts within a program by separating classes that may be called by the same name into containers.*

6. Describe specifically what using statements do.

*A using directive applies scope by automatically qualifying all objects within that specific namespace that may reference another.*

7. What is the entry point for a console app? What is the entry point for a UWP app?

*The Main method is the entry point for a console app, the App.xaml file is the entry point for a UWP app*

8. What is an assembly?

*An assembly is a file that contains classes which a program may reference and typically has a dynamic-link library suffix (.dll)
the .NET framework class library is split into assemblies based on their function.*

9. How many different versions of the WriteLine() method does the Console class contain?

*The console class provides 19 different versions of the WriteLine method.*

10. What is the relationship between an assembly and a namespace?

*A Namespace will call on classes for particular functions. These classes are stored in assemblies*

11. What is a graphical app?

*A Graphical application is a program with a graphic user interface manifesting as virtual interactive objects instead of lines of text.*

12. What does Build do?

*Build compiles the C# code, creating an executable program.*

13. (Not in book) What is bytecode? What is Microsoft CIL? Do you think that CIL is bytecode? Why
or why not?

*Bytecodes are compact numeric codes, constants, and references that form the instruction set for a software interpreter on a virtual machine.
Microsoft Common Intermediate Language (CIL) is the instruction set for common language infrastructure runtime environment. 
Both bytecode and CIL define a virtual machine or software interpreter. The CIL is represented by the dynamic link library files that pass the program to the runtime process.
CIL provides interoperability within the .NET runtime for VB, C++, F# in addition to C#. CIL appears to be the equivalent of a Java or Python bytecode for the .NET framework.*


14. What does Debug do?

*The debug function in visual studio identifies and highlights errors or exceptions in the code of a program*
